# HiggsBoson-ML

This is a university project that uses machine learning to analyze data from the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and identify the HIGGS boson particle collision. The goal of this project is to compare different machine learning models and determine the most effective method for identifying the HIGGS boson.

#Models
We are comparing several machine learning models, including:

Neural Networks
Logistic Regression


#Usage
This code is for educational and research purposes only. While we have made efforts to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the code, we cannot accept responsibility for any consequences resulting from the use of this code.

To run the code, clone this repository and run any of the models you want with a Python IDE or JypterNotebook. The dataset can be downloaded here: https://mailaub-my.sharepoint.com/:x:/g/personal/ra278_aub_edu_lb/EaDuU0lMF3lGsklq_al1q3IBubRqQp1wvLLc6INl3PnKVQ?download=1
